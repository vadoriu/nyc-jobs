    <ds:job_description>The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) protects public health and the environment by supplying clean drinking water, collecting and treating wastewater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution. DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees. DEP delivers more than 1.0 billion gallons per day of the highest quality drinking water to 8.3 million NYC residents and more than 1 million people in Upstate New York, and has a wastewater conveyance and treatment system capable of processing over 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day to protect the environment and the city’s surrounding waterways.   The Bureau of Engineering Design &amp; Construction (BEDC) currently has $10B of active construction contracts and another $3B of planning and design contracts under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implement allow DEP as a whole to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.   The primary goal for the Water for the Future Program is to repair the Rondout West Branch Tunnel (RWBT), which is currently leaking up to 35 million gallons per day. Other key components of the program include, an aqueduct interconnection project to improve operations of the tunnels leading up to the tunnel repair, water conservation geared to reduce water consumption ahead of taking the tunnel out of service for repair, and repair and rehabilitation of the Catskill Aqueduct. Additionally, a repair program is in development, while construction work has begun to bypass a specific portion of the RWBT with the bypass tunnel connection scheduled to commence in late 2022. The Gilboa Dam series of projects includes a study and rehabilitation Shandaken Tunnel and Site Restoration. This position may also involve design and construction work on other City owned infrastructure such as tunnels, shafts, bridges, roads, dams, buildings and intake and release chambers.  The Bureau of Engineering Design &amp; Construction (BEDC) seeks to hire three Associate Project Manager Level II positions to be Accountable Managers for the Water for the Future (WFF) Directorate, Gilboa Program and other City owned infrastructure.  Under the direction of a Portfolio Manager, the Accountable Managers will be the primary managers of BEDC design contracts for upstate and in City work. The Accountable Managers may support other projects as well, and supervise subordinates managing other design projects. The Accountable Managers will ensure that projects are managed in accordance with all BEDC Standard Operating Procedures and best practices to meet quality, safety, schedule, budget and client satisfaction commitments. The selected candidates will use the enterprise Project Management Information System (ePMIS) for the majority of the project workflows. They will mentor subordinate staff and work to develop and maintain a strong partnering environment amongst all internal and external stakeholders. The selected candidates will participate in design and design services during construction activities to support contracts in construction.</ds:job_description>

    <ds:job_description>The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) protects public health and the environment by supplying clean drinking water, collecting and treating wastewater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution. DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees. DEP delivers more than 1.0 billion gallons per day of the highest quality drinking water to 8.3 million NYC residents and more than 1 million people in Upstate New York, and has a wastewater conveyance and treatment system capable of processing over 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day to protect the environment and the city’s surrounding waterways.   The Bureau of Engineering Design &amp; Construction (BEDC) currently has $10B of active construction contracts and another $3B of planning and design contracts under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implement allow DEP as a whole to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.   The primary goal for the Water for the Future Program is to repair the Rondout West Branch Tunnel (RWBT), which is currently leaking up to 35 million gallons per day. Other key components of the program include, an aqueduct interconnection project to improve operations of the tunnels leading up to the tunnel repair, water conservation geared to reduce water consumption ahead of taking the tunnel out of service for repair, and repair and rehabilitation of the Catskill Aqueduct. Additionally, a repair program is in development, while construction work has begun to bypass a specific portion of the RWBT with the bypass tunnel connection scheduled to commence in late 2022. The Gilboa Dam series of projects includes a study and rehabilitation Shandaken Tunnel and Site Restoration. This position may also involve design and construction work on other City owned infrastructure such as tunnels, shafts, bridges, roads, dams, buildings and intake and release chambers.  The Bureau of Engineering Design &amp; Construction (BEDC) seeks to hire three Associate Project Manager Level II positions to be Accountable Managers for the Water for the Future (WFF) Directorate, Gilboa Program and other City owned infrastructure.  Under the direction of a Portfolio Manager, the Accountable Managers will be the primary managers of BEDC design contracts for upstate and in City work. The Accountable Managers may support other projects as well, and supervise subordinates managing other design projects. The Accountable Managers will ensure that projects are managed in accordance with all BEDC Standard Operating Procedures and best practices to meet quality, safety, schedule, budget and client satisfaction commitments. The selected candidates will use the enterprise Project Management Information System (ePMIS) for the majority of the project workflows. They will mentor subordinate staff and work to develop and maintain a strong partnering environment amongst all internal and external stakeholders. The selected candidates will participate in design and design services during construction activities to support contracts in construction.</ds:job_description>

    <ds:job_description>The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is a world-renowned agency with a long tradition of protecting and promoting health in the nation’s most culturally and linguistically diverse city.  Since its creation as the Board of Health in 1805, the DOHMH has been recognized for its innovative and groundbreaking work to protect and promote the health of over 8 million residents.  At the Mayor’s request, the DOHMH in collaboration with other city agencies have developed a plan to support the statewide effort to bring the number of new HIV infections in New York to no more than 750 per year by 2020.  The NYC plan to End the AIDS Epidemic draws upon the recommendations made in the Ending the Epidemic Task Force report (health.ny.gov/ete), and includes the following priorities: 1) promote education, distribution, and access to new medicines that prevent HIV; 2) expand delivery of new medicines; 3) support the social and physical health of marginalized populations, disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic; 4) enhance care for New Yorkers with HIV; 5) use state-of-the-art science to improve HIV prevention efforts.  With fewer than 750 new infections each year, the City will experience a natural and progressive decline in the total number of people with HIV/AIDS.   The Bureau of Sexually Transmitted Disease Control (BSTDC) has the mission of improving the sexual health of all New Yorkers. To achieve this, the Bureau provides direct clinical services to people seeking sexual health care, and services to sex partners; monitors disease trends; provides education and training to providers and community groups, conducts research and develop policies to improve sexual health and wellness.

    <ds:job_description>The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is seeking to fill the position of Deputy Commissioner for the Bureau of Wastewater Treatment, a position that offers the unique opportunity to lead a critical public health and environmental operation in the most amazing city in the country.   DEP’s 6,000 employees are dedicated to protecting public health and the environment by supplying clean drinking water, collecting and treating wastewater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous material pollution. The scale of our organization is unmatched by any other water utility in the nation – each day, DEP delivers one billion gallons of high quality drinking water a day to more than nine million New Yorkers and collects and treats an average of 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater at 14 wastewater treatment plants. As a result of DEP’s investments in our wastewater treatment system, the New York Harbor is the cleanest it has been in more than a century. To support these functions, DEP has one of the largest capital construction portfolios in the City, with $11 billion of work under construction and an additional $3 billion in design.  Reporting to the Commissioner, the Deputy Commissioner will provide leadership and policy direction for the largest of DEP’s bureaus, with an annual operating budget of $387 million and 1,800 employees. The bureau’s robust infrastructure includes 14 wastewater treatment plants, eight sludge dewatering facilities, 96 wastewater pumping stations, five wastewater and three microbiology laboratories, and related facilities and marine vessels for transporting sludge and monitoring waterways.   The Bureau of Wastewater Treatment is led by the Deputy Commissioner with two supporting Assistant Commissioners. The bureau consists of the following divisions:  •	Plant Operations  •	Collections &amp; Residuals Management  •	Engineering &amp; Budget  •	Capital Planning &amp; Asset Management  •	Regulatory Compliance &amp; Administration  •	Environmental Health &amp; Safety   The Deputy Commissioner will be responsible for leading continuous improvements in wastewater operations and sustaining DEP’s national reputation within the industry for innovation, excellence, and safety. Maintaining the system in a state of good repair and planning future upgrades will be of tremendous importance in this role. The Deputy Commissioner will work collaboratively with the executive team to develop and implement innovative solutions to more effectively manage storm water, protect critical infrastructure from sea level rise, and address the other challenges posed by climate change.  DEP is one of the largest users of energy in the City.  The Deputy Commissioner will be responsible for realizing substantial reductions in energy consumption by employing innovative processes including the reuse of methane gas.   In addition, the Deputy Commissioner will be responsible for making final recommendations to the Commissioner concerning extremely complex, technical, and often controversial programs concerning Federal and State water-quality based programs and permits and for:  •	directing and tracking the Bureau's budget and expenditures;  •	developing alternative solutions to providing wastewater treatment service; •	representing DEP at public meetings where facilities and service issues are addressed; •	establishing policies and procedures;  •	coaching and evaluating management personnel; and,  •	directing the preparation of statistical and narrative reports including the Annual New York Harbor Water Quality Survey and Discharge Monitoring Reports for submission to City, State, and Federal agencies to comply with regulatory requirements.  The Deputy Commissioner will also be responsible for working with three other major DEP operating bureaus (Water Supply, Water &amp; Sewer Operations, and Engineering Design and Construction) to ensure that DEP optimizes its resources and impact through internal collaboration and strategic planning. The Deputy Commissioner must also be effective in working with consultants, City agencies and executives, and other external stakeholders to ensure that all Bureau of Wastewater Treatment programs are understood and effectively implemented.   The Deputy Commissioner position requires excellent leadership, communication, and presentation skills as well as passion for driving innovation, continuous improvement and efficiency, and implementing workforce strategies to recruit, develop, and retain the most qualified and diverse talent in wastewater operations nationwide.  This position requires leadership and visibility nationally in promoting industry best practices and collaborating with industry peers and associations.</ds:job_description>

    <ds:job_description>The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is seeking to fill the position of Deputy Commissioner for the Bureau of Wastewater Treatment, a position that offers the unique opportunity to lead a critical public health and environmental operation in the most amazing city in the country.   DEP’s 6,000 employees are dedicated to protecting public health and the environment by supplying clean drinking water, collecting and treating wastewater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous material pollution. The scale of our organization is unmatched by any other water utility in the nation – each day, DEP delivers one billion gallons of high quality drinking water a day to more than nine million New Yorkers and collects and treats an average of 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater at 14 wastewater treatment plants. As a result of DEP’s investments in our wastewater treatment system, the New York Harbor is the cleanest it has been in more than a century. To support these functions, DEP has one of the largest capital construction portfolios in the City, with $11 billion of work under construction and an additional $3 billion in design.  Reporting to the Commissioner, the Deputy Commissioner will provide leadership and policy direction for the largest of DEP’s bureaus, with an annual operating budget of $387 million and 1,800 employees. The bureau’s robust infrastructure includes 14 wastewater treatment plants, eight sludge dewatering facilities, 96 wastewater pumping stations, five wastewater and three microbiology laboratories, and related facilities and marine vessels for transporting sludge and monitoring waterways.   The Bureau of Wastewater Treatment is led by the Deputy Commissioner with two supporting Assistant Commissioners. The bureau consists of the following divisions:  •	Plant Operations  •	Collections &amp; Residuals Management  •	Engineering &amp; Budget  •	Capital Planning &amp; Asset Management  •	Regulatory Compliance &amp; Administration  •	Environmental Health &amp; Safety   The Deputy Commissioner will be responsible for leading continuous improvements in wastewater operations and sustaining DEP’s national reputation within the industry for innovation, excellence, and safety. Maintaining the system in a state of good repair and planning future upgrades will be of tremendous importance in this role. The Deputy Commissioner will work collaboratively with the executive team to develop and implement innovative solutions to more effectively manage storm water, protect critical infrastructure from sea level rise, and address the other challenges posed by climate change.  DEP is one of the largest users of energy in the City.  The Deputy Commissioner will be responsible for realizing substantial reductions in energy consumption by employing innovative processes including the reuse of methane gas.   In addition, the Deputy Commissioner will be responsible for making final recommendations to the Commissioner concerning extremely complex, technical, and often controversial programs concerning Federal and State water-quality based programs and permits and for:  •	directing and tracking the Bureau's budget and expenditures;  •	developing alternative solutions to providing wastewater treatment service; •	representing DEP at public meetings where facilities and service issues are addressed; •	establishing policies and procedures;  •	coaching and evaluating management personnel; and,  •	directing the preparation of statistical and narrative reports including the Annual New York Harbor Water Quality Survey and Discharge Monitoring Reports for submission to City, State, and Federal agencies to comply with regulatory requirements.  The Deputy Commissioner will also be responsible for working with three other major DEP operating bureaus (Water Supply, Water &amp; Sewer Operations, and Engineering Design and Construction) to ensure that DEP optimizes its resources and impact through internal collaboration and strategic planning. The Deputy Commissioner must also be effective in working with consultants, City agencies and executives, and other external stakeholders to ensure that all Bureau of Wastewater Treatment programs are understood and effectively implemented.   The Deputy Commissioner position requires excellent leadership, communication, and presentation skills as well as passion for driving innovation, continuous improvement and efficiency, and implementing workforce strategies to recruit, develop, and retain the most qualified and diverse talent in wastewater operations nationwide.  This position requires leadership and visibility nationally in promoting industry best practices and collaborating with industry peers and associations.</ds:job_description>

The NYC plan to End the AIDS Epidemic draws upon the recommendations made in the Ending the Epidemic Task Force report (health.ny.gov/ete), and includes the following priorities: 1) promote education, distribution, and access to new medicines that prevent HIV; 2) expand delivery of new medicines; 3) support the social and physical health of marginalized populations, disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic; 4) enhance care for New Yorkers with HIV; 5) use state-of-the-art science to improve HIV prevention efforts.  With fewer than 750 new infections each year, the City will experience a natural and progressive decline in the total number of people with HIV/AIDS.   The Bureau of Sexually Transmitted Disease Control (BSTDC) has the mission of improving the sexual health of all New Yorkers. To achieve this, the Bureau provides direct clinical services to people seeking sexual health care, and services to sex partners; monitors disease trends; provides education and training to providers and community groups, conducts research and develop policies to improve sexual health and wellness. The BSTDC operates 8 STD clinics throughout New York City (NYC).  The BSTDC is seeking four public health professional to serve as Navigation Supervisors.    DUTIES WILL INCLUDE BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO:  •	Supervising patient navigators who are providing HIV prevention services.  •	Supervising the distribution of caseload and establishment of deadlines among patient navigators.   •	Conducting presentations in the waiting areas and other assigned facilities providing public health information on STD/HIV/AIDS/hepatitis and related issues as well as strategies for risk reduction.  •	Providing supervision of navigation services, including insurance enrollment, entitlements programs, and outside referrals.  •	 Monitoring follow-up activities to assure complete, accurate, timely entries and assisting.  in the case review of patients enrolled in one of the HIV programs within the STD clinic.  •	Maintaining liaison with health care providers and others including public and private agencies to expedite the efficient follow-up and treatment of patients enrolled in program.</ds:job_description>

    <ds:job_description>The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) protects public health and the environment by supplying clean drinking water, collecting and treating wastewater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution. DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees. DEP delivers more than 1.1 billion gallons per day of the highest quality drinking water to 8.3 billion NYC residents and more than 1 million people in Upstate New York, and has a wastewater conveyance and treatment system capable of processing over 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day to protect the environment and the city’s surrounding waterways. The Bureau of Engineering Design &amp; Construction (BEDC) currently has $10B of active construction contracts and another $3B of planning and design contracts under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implement allow DEP as a whole to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.  The Bureau of Engineering Design &amp; Construction seeks to hire two civil service Civil Engineer II for the In-House Design (IHD) Division, located in Corona, Queens, NY. BEDC’s In-House Design division consists of nine engineering sections corresponding to the respective engineering functions they perform. This includes the Architectural, Civil, Structural, Process Mechanical, HVAC, Water Tunnel Structural, Water Tunnel Mechanical Systems, CAD, and Electrical sections plus two additional non-engineering sections, Quality Assurance and Quality Assurance Lab. Each engineering section prepares design and construction documents including engineering plans and specifications for the construction of water supply, sewer and wastewater treatment infrastructure which are of the highest priority for the Agency. Part of the BEDC’s IHD division, the Tunnel Structural Design (TSD) section is responsible for the design of some of the NYC DEP’s largest “clean water” capital projects including the Water for the Future program.   The NYC DEP is the only public agency in the United States that maintains internal expertise in the design and construction of deep rock tunnels. The TSD Section helps maintain the DEP’s proud century-old legacy of designing and managing the construction of all of New York City’s water supply tunnel infrastructure. Tapping into decades of internal experience and utilizing modern design techniques like finite element modeling (FEM) and analysis, the TSD Section is tasked with creating biddable structural design documents including calculations, drawings, and specifications. Projects include water tunnels and shafts, distribution chambers, and other subsurface and surface structures related to the City’s water delivery systems. TSD also provides design services during construction (DSDC) and advices and assists other IHD sections with their structural engineering design needs. TSD regularly coordinates with BEDC’s other sections, DEP’s operating bureaus, and DEP’s outside engineering consultants as well.

    <ds:job_description>The Bureau of Mental Health is responsible for mental health service delivery and planning for New York City residents with mental health needs. Through contracting directly with NYC service providers, the Bureau is responsible for procuring and overseeing over 700 treatment, rehabilitation, housing, case management, advocacy, and Assisted Outpatient Treatment programs comprising over $200 million. Bureau staff is responsible for managing the development, implementation, and oversight of ongoing and new contracted mental health programs. Through these contracts and through its policy, planning and advocacy work, the Bureau seeks to facilitate access and quality care and recovery for all New York City residents.   The Office of Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) is responsible for the management and oversight of the Assisted Outpatient Treatment Program in New York City.

    <ds:job_description>The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) protects public health and the environment by supplying clean drinking water, collecting and treating wastewater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution. DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees. DEP delivers more than 1.1 billion gallons per day of the highest quality drinking water to 8.5 million NYC residents and more than 1 million people in Upstate New York, and has a wastewater conveyance and treatment system capable of processing over 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day to protect the environment and the city’s surrounding waterways. The DEP’s Bureau of Engineering Design &amp; Construction (BEDC) currently has $10B of active construction contracts and another $3B of planning and design contracts under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implements allow DEP to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.  BEDC’s Wastewater Capital Program (WWCP) staff oversee the design and construction of all capital projects managed on behalf of the Bureau of Wastewater Treatment (BWT). Currently, WWCP manages the capital delivery requirements for 14 treatment plants and 95 pump stations, as well as other DEP owned facilities. Some of the capital projects delivered for BWT include Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Abatement program projects; Sewage Treatment Plant and Pumping Station Upgrades and/or Expansions; and Landfill Remediation work. WWCP includes over $6 billion in active work, and approximately $300 million to $500 million in new work annually. WWCP consists of a group of approximately 80 project managers and engineers who manage capital projects consistent with BEDC’s project delivery and construction management procedures, with an emphasis on environmental health and safety, scope, schedule, budget, and client service.   WWCP’s North division includes capital project delivery for the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), Red Hook WWTP, Owl’s Head WWTP, Port Richmond WWTP, and Oakwood Beach WWTP. Facility wide programs include the delivery of the projects included in DEP’s Total Residual Chlorine Reduction Program at all WWTPs. Some major projects in the WWCP North division include the North River WWTP Cogeneration and Electrification Program, Electrical Power Distribution Upgrade projects at North River and Port Richmond WWTPs, Tank Upgrade Program to upgrade the treatment tanks at the North River, Red Hook, Port Richmond, and Owl’s Head WWTPs, and Structural Improvements of the North River WWTP.  The Bureau of Engineering Design &amp; Construction seeks to hire an Associate Project Manager III/Accountable Manager for the WWCP, located in LeFrak City, Queens, NY.    Through a staff of project managers, inspectors and/or other technical/administrative staff, the Accountable Manager (AM) directs the oversight of the design and construction of projects for a program that will allow the DEP to meet its wastewater treatment requirements into the future. The AM will be responsible for the achievement of project goals and milestones, ensuring that all prepared schedules, reports, and work products conform to the scope of work. Also, the AM undertakes the preparation, negotiation, and processing of appropriate modifications to Consultant Contract scope, cost, and schedule for successful project completion.  S/he will provide a day-to-day guidance and oversight of subordinates’ work assignments, motivate current employees, approve time and leave, evaluate staff members and determine staffing requirements for implementation of the program. The AM must ensure that Environmental Health &amp; Safety is incorporated throughout the project lifecycle and must be focused on client service to the operating bureaus.  The AM is responsible for the implementation of all project delivery procedures and coordination with all bureau support divisions, such as the Project Controls Group (Schedule &amp; Cost), Permit Resource Division, Sustainability, Contracts Support, etc.  The AM must be a “hands-on” engineer capable of quickly recognizing what is required for a project and providing the sustained effort necessary to see that project through from conception to completion. The AM is responsible for the seamless communication/coordination with Agency Bureaus, other City Agencies, and key Stakeholders.  The AM must focus on issues resolution and risk mitigation to keep the project moving and must manage the quality of the project delivery throughout the project lifecycle. Where necessary, the AM will be responsible for managing staff efficiently and effectively to ensure adequate staffing of projects and opportunities for professional growth.  The AM is also responsible for continuous monitoring of key performance indicators with respect to Scope, Schedule, Budget, and other project performance metrics.  The AM reports directly to the Portfolio Manager.</ds:job_description>

    <ds:job_description>The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) protects public health and the environment by supplying clean drinking water, collecting and treating wastewater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution. DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees. DEP delivers more than 1.1 billion gallons per day of the highest quality drinking water to 8.5 million NYC residents and more than 1 million people in Upstate New York, and has a wastewater conveyance and treatment system capable of processing over 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day to protect the environment and the city’s surrounding waterways. The DEP’s Bureau of Engineering Design &amp; Construction (BEDC) currently has $10B of active construction contracts and another $3B of planning and design contracts under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implements allow DEP to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.  BEDC’s Wastewater Capital Program (WWCP) staff oversee the design and construction of all capital projects managed on behalf of the Bureau of Wastewater Treatment (BWT). Currently, WWCP manages the capital delivery requirements for 14 treatment plants and 95 pump stations, as well as other DEP owned facilities. Some of the capital projects delivered for BWT include Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Abatement program projects; Sewage Treatment Plant and Pumping Station Upgrades and/or Expansions; and Landfill Remediation work. WWCP includes over $6 billion in active work, and approximately $300 million to $500 million in new work annually. WWCP consists of a group of approximately 80 project managers and engineers who manage capital projects consistent with BEDC’s project delivery and construction management procedures, with an emphasis on environmental health and safety, scope, schedule, budget, and client service.   WWCP’s North division includes capital project delivery for the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), Red Hook WWTP, Owl’s Head WWTP, Port Richmond WWTP, and Oakwood Beach WWTP. Facility wide programs include the delivery of the projects included in DEP’s Total Residual Chlorine Reduction Program at all WWTPs. Some major projects in the WWCP North division include the North River WWTP Cogeneration and Electrification Program, Electrical Power Distribution Upgrade projects at North River and Port Richmond WWTPs, Tank Upgrade Program to upgrade the treatment tanks at the North River, Red Hook, Port Richmond, and Owl’s Head WWTPs, and Structural Improvements of the North River WWTP.  The Bureau of Engineering Design &amp; Construction seeks to hire an Associate Project Manager III/Accountable Manager for the WWCP, located in LeFrak City, Queens, NY.    Through a staff of project managers, inspectors and/or other technical/administrative staff, the Accountable Manager (AM) directs the oversight of the design and construction of projects for a program that will allow the DEP to meet its wastewater treatment requirements into the future. The AM will be responsible for the achievement of project goals and milestones, ensuring that all prepared schedules, reports, and work products conform to the scope of work. Also, the AM undertakes the preparation, negotiation, and processing of appropriate modifications to Consultant Contract scope, cost, and schedule for successful project completion.  S/he will provide a day-to-day guidance and oversight of subordinates’ work assignments, motivate current employees, approve time and leave, evaluate staff members and determine staffing requirements for implementation of the program. The AM must ensure that Environmental Health &amp; Safety is incorporated throughout the project lifecycle and must be focused on client service to the operating bureaus.  The AM is responsible for the implementation of all project delivery procedures and coordination with all bureau support divisions, such as the Project Controls Group (Schedule &amp; Cost), Permit Resource Division, Sustainability, Contracts Support, etc.  The AM must be a “hands-on” engineer capable of quickly recognizing what is required for a project and providing the sustained effort necessary to see that project through from conception to completion. The AM is responsible for the seamless communication/coordination with Agency Bureaus, other City Agencies, and key Stakeholders.  The AM must focus on issues resolution and risk mitigation to keep the project moving and must manage the quality of the project delivery throughout the project lifecycle. Where necessary, the AM will be responsible for managing staff efficiently and effectively to ensure adequate staffing of projects and opportunities for professional growth.  The AM is also responsible for continuous monitoring of key performance indicators with respect to Scope, Schedule, Budget, and other project performance metrics.  The AM reports directly to the Portfolio Manager.</ds:job_description>

DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees. DEP delivers more than 1.1 billion gallons per day of the highest quality drinking water to 8.3 billion NYC residents and more than 1 million people in Upstate New York, and has a wastewater conveyance and treatment system capable of processing over 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day to protect the environment and the city’s surrounding waterways. The Bureau of Engineering Design &amp; Construction (BEDC) currently has $10B of active construction contracts and another $3B of planning and design contracts under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implement allow DEP as a whole to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.  The Program Management Office (PMO) within BEDC provides technical support to the project delivery teams.  Project Controls, Schedule Controls, Permitting Support, Sustainability Review, Cost Estimating, Specifications Oversight, and management of the enterprise Program Management Information System all fall under the purview of the PMO.   Under the PMO, DEP is currently in the process of replacing our legacy Project Management Information System (PMIS) with a new, redesigned enterprise project management and construction management system, ePMIS.  DEP’s overall objective is to implement a best-in-class information system to improve delivery of our capital projects by creating efficiencies in our critical business processes and to make information readily available to stakeholders across the program. All projects will use the system to streamline efforts and to consistently measure and improve performance. E-Builder was identified as a core component of this custom-designed Enterprise PMIS (ePMIS) solution.  E-Builder is a cloud-based construction program management software designed to improve project execution, boost productivity, improve overall organization, and facilitate the completion of projects.   The Bureau of Engineering Design &amp; Construction seeks to hire an Administrative Project Manager (NM) for the PMO division, located in the Lefrak City office in Elmhurst, NY to support the optimization of the PMIS system.  Continuous improvement to project delivery is key to BEDC’s success and forms the foundation of their core values of Safety, Client Service, Quality, Budget and Schedule.  In support of these core values, BEDC has developed comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that define consistent processes that each project must adhere to. Organizationally, BEDC drives ownership and oversight through a hierarchy of project focused Accountable Managers, Portfolio Managers and Capital Program Directors that are responsible for ensuring the successful planning, design, construction and closeout of their projects. Given the large number of projects requiring consistent processes and information, BEDC determined that a program-wide project and construction management information system was necessary. The objectives of the system are to improve capital project delivery by creating efficiencies in critical business processes, making information more readily available to stakeholders, streamlining efforts to setup and manage new projects and allowing for consistency in project performance management under one sustainable information technology support model.    This is an exciting opportunity to manage the development efforts and oversee the architecture of this system.  This position oversees &amp; directs a group of business systems analysts responsible for managing current process footprint and where applicable partnering with BEDC staff to simplify and transform the processes in coordination with the implementation manager.  The selected candidate will be responsible for overseeing the development of dashboards and the strategic roadmap for system expansion and improvement considering e-Builder, Tableau and Microsoft Azure product development roadmaps.  The selected candidate will be required to work with the Office of Technology to ensure the system is being supported and enhanced as necessary.    Qualifications will include the following:  • Strategic thinking, forward looking and ability to manage and understand tactical issues in order to lead and implement continuous process improvement • Sound business judgment, compulsive attention to detail, exceptional customer service skills and the drive to meet customer needs in a manner consistent with and in support of BEDC’s overall strategies • Possess strong business systems analysis and business integration background • Strong background with enterprise systems platforms • Good understanding of application development, quality assurance and testing technologies and processes • Experience in developing close working relationships with business partners  • Ability to apply conceptual knowledge of SOP processes and technology to solve complex process and procedural problems • Ability to quickly establish credibility &amp; foster collaborative relationships  • Strong Project Management skills and leadership abilities are required • Excellent written and oral communication, inter-personal, presentation skills and team skills • Proven ability to excel in a dynamic environment with concurrent priorities • Ability to communicate at different levels: motivate and lead staff, collaborate and problem solve with peers, inform and guide management • Working knowledge of business requirements across Engineering, Design, Construction, and Finance  Specific responsibilities include:  • Gain a firm understanding of the ePMIS architecture including several cloud-based solutions • Identify resources needed and determine individual responsibilities for development and enhancement of the PMIS system • Create and execute project work plans and revise as needed • Lead strategic and methodological execution of deliverables • Review deliverables, engagement reviews and maintain quality assurance procedures • Work in conjunction with the implementation manager and vendors, and validate the translation of business requirements into technical solutions • Drive and coordinate vendor proposals, and recommend subsequent scope and implementation adjustments where necessary • Provide executive-level updates on all activities • Facilitate team and client meetings effectively, including regular status meetings with the project team (portfolio companies, implementation vendors and management team) • Develop and continuously refine best practices and development methodology • Work with leaders to understand and outline project timelines and expectations • Migrate data as requested to new system • Quality check data migration • Set up testing end users for new software application • Communicate with all levels of organization and vendors • Provide feedback to leadership on all phases of development and recommend next steps throughout • Assists users to maximize the benefit from use PMIS functionality • Assists the BEDC PMO Director and ePMIS Chief with project coordination, tracking, implementation, development, training and support • Conducts continuous research and analysis into the nature, effect and results of current and potential system problems • Conducts continuous research and analysis into possible business solutions through web and enterprise technologies</ds:job_description>
